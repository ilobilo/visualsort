# VisualSort
Simple sorting algorithm visualiser in C++ with ncurses.\
I made this project to play around with modules.

## Building and Running
* [Install ``xmake``](https://xmake.io/#/getting_started?id=installation)
* You may need to set the llvm installation directory to make standard library modules work: (for example ``/usr/bin/llvm-19/`` on Ubuntu)\
```xmake f --sdk=<sdk>```
* ``xmake build``
* ``xmake run``
